Open Source Projects sponsored by Vendor Voice Media

I am interested in developing software applications specifically designed for problem solvers within the IT community. That is, ultimately, my future users I fully expect to be folks like you, who use Github and other solutions for designing, developing, and debugging complex web services and mobile applications. 

This is my first venture into using Github, and my intent here is to find and source a community of developers for a handful of web-proberties currently in the research phase. I anticipate keeping some of these properties in the OpenSource domain, where others I may move to private repositories for proprietary work. I look forward to working with you all!

Sincerely,
